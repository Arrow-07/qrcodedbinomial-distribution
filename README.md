# QR Coded Binomial Distribution

This project provides a simple web interface to calculate the binomial distribution of an event. The binomial distribution is a statistical formula that defines the probability of an event occurring a specific number of times, given the event's probability of success and the number of trials.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input parameters such as the probability of success (Z), the number of trials (X), and the desired number of successful outcomes (Y) to compute the probability.
## QRCODE

## Usage

1. **Access the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. **Input Parameters**:
   - **Probability of Success (Z)**: Enter the probability of the event's success (a value between 0 and 1).
   - **Number of Trials (X)**: Enter the total number of trials or observations.
   - **Desired Number of Successes (Y)**: Enter the number of times you want the event to occur successfully.
3. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to compute the binomial probability.

## Example

If you want to calculate the probability of flipping a fair coin (probability of success Z = 0.5) 10 times (X = 10) and getting exactly 6 heads (Y = 6):

- Set Z = 0.5
- Set X = 10
- Set Y = 6

After clicking "Calculate," the application will display the probability.
